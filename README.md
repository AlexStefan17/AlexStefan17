# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex

I'm an engineer with experience in **QA Automation**, **DevOps** and **infrastructure**. I’m passionate about Devops, Infrastructure, Linux, and automation.

## 🛠️ Some of my projects

### 🏠 [HomeLab](https://github.com/AlexStefan17/homelab)  
A personal lab built on **Proxmox** (Type 1 hypervisor), featuring multiple Linux VMs and a wide range of infrastructure services. This setup serves as a hands-on environment for learning, testing, and automating real-world scenarios.

**🔹 Technologies:** Proxmox, Docker, Ansible, Linux, Bash, Kubernetes (k3s), OPNsense, Prometheus, Grafana  
**🔹 Highlights:**
- Infrastructure as Code automation for environment provisioning with **Terraform** and **Ansible**
- Monitoring with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**
- Media server with **ARR stack** and **Jellyfin** 
- **NAS** setup with **NFS** and **SMB**  
- Reverse proxy with **NGINX Ingress** on **Kubernetes (k3s)**  
- Internal **DNS server** and secure remote access with **WireGuard VPN**  
- Enhanced networking with **OPNsense firewall** and a managed switch

### 🧪 [HiveBox-DevOps](https://github.com/AlexStefan17/HiveBox-DevOps)
An end‑to‑end DevOps hands-on project inspired by the [HiveBox project on devopsroadmap.io](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/), designed to cover the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a dynamic, iterative MVP-style approach.

**🔹 Technologies:** Docker, Kubernetes, Ingress NGINX, Flask, Prometheus, GitHub Actions  
**🔹 Highlights:**  
- Complete progressive build of a RESTful API that tracks environmental sensor data (e.g. openSenseMap), starting from planning and coding through CI/CD and infrastructure
- Covers planning, quality assurance, containerization, observability, integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure in sequential hands-on phases
- Emphasizes practical tasks over just following tools: every PR represents a new phase in the MVP-style roadmap

### 🧭 [DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/DevOps-Roadmap-AlexStefan/repositories)  
A GitHub organization where I document my journey of learning and practicing DevOps, following the structure of the [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops).

**🔹 What you’ll find:**  
- Repositories covering key DevOps topics like Bash scripting, Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and networking  
- Practical tasks and small projects focused on applying real-world DevOps skills  
- A growing collection of work that shows my practical experience and continuous learning in DevOps
